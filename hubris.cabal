                .
                short version: ./Setup configure --enable-shared --ghc-options=-dynamic --extra-include-dirs=... --extra-lib-dirs=...
                .
                If you omit any of those flags, it will seem to work then blow up at runtime.
                .
                Anyway, this version strips the boilerplate that used to be necessary, and is intended to be used in conjunction with <http://github.com/mwotton/Hubris>.

  -- This is bad form, apparently, and if i include it, ./Setup dist cries big fat tears,
  --  but you _really_ want a dynamic lib with Hubrify, or you'll get a truly
  -- huge binary (may not even link, I had problems with the iconv dependency from HSbase)
  -- anyway, pass "--ghc-options=-dynamic" to ./Setup configure, and you should be apples.
  -- ghc-options: -dynamic
